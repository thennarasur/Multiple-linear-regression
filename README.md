# Multiple-linear-regression

**Goal**

To build a linear regression model to predict mileage of the car based on various features of the car.

**Data source**

This dataset contains various attributes of cars that were produced in US,Europe and japan.
It has 9 attributes and 398 records. I took this dataset from UCI machine learning repository.

The link to the dataset:
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg)

**Description**

This dataset contains eight independent variables and one dependent variable. predictor variables are different attributes of car.
Our target variable is mpg(miles per gallon). we need to predict mileage of the car based on various attributes.

I used scikit learn library to build the model.
I developed a regression model that predicts the target variable with 79% accuracy.
